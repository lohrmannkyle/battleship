# Test 1 (error)
# Validates that program exits on duplicates ship type
Using an input file that creates two of the same ship like such:
    A 6 0 6 4
    S 6 5 6 7
    B 2 7 5 7
    D 3 4 3 6
    D 4 4 4 6
# End of test

# Test 2 (error)
# Validates that the program exits upon creating less than 5 unique ships
Input is an input file that generates less than 5 of differing ship types like such:
    A 6 0 6 4
    S 6 5 6 7
    B 2 7 5 7
    D 3 4 3 6
# End of test


# Test 3 (regular)
# Validates game ends without errors upon no more guesses but ships remaining
    Guess input has less than enough guess to sink all ships
# End of test

# Test 4 (regular)
# Validates games exits and prints "all ships sunk: game over" upon sinking all ships
    Guess file contains enough guesses that sink all ships
# End of test

# Test 5 (error)
# Validates ships must match the required ship length for each type
Ship input file contains a ship that doesn't match required specification
for example:
    D 4 4 4 7 (size of 4 when should be 3)
# End of test
